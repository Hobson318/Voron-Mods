Mounting tray for the Klipper Expander Board. I didn't care for the other 2 mounts i tried. Requires 2 M3 x 6mm screws.
There are 2 versions of this mount. 
1: Only has a logo on the back for use with VHB tape
2: Has logo and 6 M3 countersunk holes for bhcs for mounting on rails (you may need to trim one of the soldered pins sticking out of the bottom if it is too long)
